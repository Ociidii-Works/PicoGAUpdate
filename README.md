# PicoGAUpdate
Small utility to update graphics drivers

### This tool offers very limited customizability and is mostly intended for automation purposes.
If you require fine-grained features selection for NVIDIA devices, see [NVCleanInstall](https://www.techpowerup.com/nvcleanstall/) instead.

Consult the output of the `--help` command for all options.

Note: Support for Intel and AMD is planned but not currently implemented
