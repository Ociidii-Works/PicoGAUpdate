# PicoGAUpdate
## Small utility to update graphics drivers
The most useful command line flag to run this with is `--strip`:
```
-x, --strip             Attempt to strip all components deemed useless by this tool's developer(s).
```
Consult the output of the `--help` command for all options.

Note: Support for Intel and AMD is planned but not currently implemented
